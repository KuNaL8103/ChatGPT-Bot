### ChatGPT Bot
use chatgpt api to code a chatgpt bot with javascript. A project that you can ask anything from chatgpt with javascript❗️
Also we use Rapidapi in this bot too! we use official chatgpt api.

## Warning
You need to get your own API key and replace it in index.js file and also if there is a model for a different API then also modify the body part in the code :

```javascript
'X-RapidAPI-Key': 'Your API Key',
```
```javascript
body: `{"model" = "model name", "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"${message}"}]}`
```
